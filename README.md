## Moin, hello, salut, **こんにちは。** 

🎨 Art director specialized in UX, illustration, 3D, typography.
→ Not a programmer, but an enthusiast.

I spend my childhood in my parent's photographic studio for most of the time – influenced by the surrounding creativity and one Macintosh LC – passionate about using computers as an aid to visualize graphical relations, creating immersive environments and intuitive user experiences.

If you want to get in touch send me an email at hello at nelsonfritsch dot de.
