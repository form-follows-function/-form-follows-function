## Moin, hello, salut, **こんにちは** 

Art director specialized in UX design.
I'm not a programmer, but an **enthusiast**.

Passionate about using computers as an aid to visualize graphical relations, creating immersive environments and intuitive user experiences.

I spend my childhood in my parent's photographic studio for most of the time – influenced by the surrounding creativity and one Macintosh LC. 

I'am a tech-savvy open-source supporter, passionated about typography, 3D graphics, illustration, as well as software security. 
If you want to get in touch send me an email hello at nelsonfritsch dot de.
